# citibike-data-exploration

Citibike, a bike sharing program in NYC, collects, maintains, and makes public (data)[https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data] about the entire bikeshare system and all rides made. On a personal level, Citibike allows users to download their trip history from the "Trips" link in [their user profile](https://member.citibikenyc.com/profile/). The available personal data consists of each trip's starting dock, starting time, ending dock, ending time and the duration of the trip. 

This repository will serve as a scratchpad for analysis of the available Citbike data, starting with my personal data. For example, Citibike assumes that riders ride 7.456 miles per hour (if one does not opt into their Ride Insights program). Do I ride faster or slower than the assumed speed? Is there any relationship between the length (distance) of the trip and the average speed I ride?
